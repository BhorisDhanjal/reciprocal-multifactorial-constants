# Reciprocal Multifactorial Constants
**This repository consists of:**
1. Mathematica Notebook used for the project (and PDF render)
2. LaTeX source code of the project document (and PDF render)
3. Latex source code of the presentation document (and PDF render)

The Mathematica notebook (.nb) comprises of the code used for visualizations and computations in my FYBSc Mathematics project. I have also attached a .pdf render of the .nb file if you wish to only read the code input and output. 

If you want to run the (.nb) code then you can do so for free using https://www.wolfram.com/player/ or using Mathematica.

**Note**: Viewing the .nb file on github will NOT show you the code used. If you want to view the code input and output please view the .pdf attached.
