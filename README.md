This is a Mathematica notebook (.nb) comprising of the code used for visualizations and calculations in my FYBSc Mathematics project. I have also attached a .pdf render of the .nb file if you wish to only read the code input and output.

If you wish to run the (.nb) code then you can do so for free using https://www.wolfram.com/player/ or using Mathematica.
